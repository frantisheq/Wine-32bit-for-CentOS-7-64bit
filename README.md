##About##

Since version 7, RHEL has only x86-64 version. The same for CentOS 7. In CentOS 7/EPEL, there is only package for Wine x86-64. However, many Windows .exe files are 32-bit. Even there are 64-bit versions for some software, their installation file is 32-bit. And for some certain software such as Office 2007, 32-bit wine is preferred.

We will check how to install 32-bit Wine 1.8 on CentOS 7. We will use Wine 1.8.4 as the example.
